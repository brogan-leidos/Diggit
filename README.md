# Grid TEst

TODO:
 - Change object system to use a text parser. Should allow for more dynamic shapes and the ability to rotate
   -- After that add sprite sheets for objects and add a function to return a sprite section relative to the origin
 - Do something with biomes, heat could affect hardness of soil or something
 - Upgrade revealed highlight to track edges
 - Update the soil building algorithm to use noise instead of random assignment
  - Generate pressure points using noise (hurt the wall more when hit)
 - Add ability to actually collect loot
 - Add a shop or something where you can spend your loot
 - Think/Add some more tools
 - Replace solid colors with images

BUGS:
 - Not a bug, but need to change hitting system to account for future pressure points
