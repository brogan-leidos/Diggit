# Grid TEst

IN PROGRESS:
 - Make it "cost" something to dig, prevent the player from spamming hammer and collecting loot
 - Adding a shop (Buy new items, repair items(?), Upgrade existing items
 - Adding new biomes
   -> Desert (Pressure points)
   -> Volcano (lava plumes that fill the site)
   -> Forest (high vegatation, vegtables baby)
   -> Lakeside/Ocean (oil or something?
   -> Frozen area (Ice sheets that crack as one unit)

TODO: (prioritized from highest to lowest)
 - Add a shop or something where you can spend your loot
 - Revamp inventory to use like... a material system or something? Idk, crafting and building whatever

 - Ability to travel between biomes
   -- Biomes (heat could affect hardness of soil and health of wall or something) 
 - Generate pressure points using noise (hurt the wall more when hit)
 - Update the soil building algorithm to use noise instead of random assignment

 - Replace solid colors with images
 - Add rotation to parts with unique shapes
   -- After that add sprite sheets for objects and add a function to return a sprite section relative to the origin
   -- with transparency!
 - Upgrade revealed highlight to track edges
 - Think/Add some more tools
   -> A tool that lets you mine in an X (foil to the pick)
   -> "line" bombs

BUGS:
 - Not a bug, but need to change hitting system to account for future pressure points
