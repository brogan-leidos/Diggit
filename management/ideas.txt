Ideas:

 - A large overworld map, start in one area and make your way to different regions
   -- Different regions (biomes) will have different things to offer in terms of loot and surfaces (leave pressure points for a region)
   -- Need supplies to travel between regions, eat moss or something from the ground to make the trips
 
 - Upgrade your tools and get new ones as you search different regions (more power, less damage)
 
 - A large final quest that requires going back to all of the regions and finding something special from each one
